        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Avery Smith. I am a small streamer who is very interested in streaming games with my friends and younger brother. I stream mainly Dead by Daylight, but I also enjoy playing Gears 5, Overwatch, The Binding of Isaac, and practically any FromSoftware game.</p>

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <ul class="faq">
            <li><strong>Why is my Schedule so Inconsistent?</strong><br> I am a young streamer, and as such, I still live with my family and attend school. I stream as much as I can, however I cannot promise a consistent schedule as I offer tutoring services, have homework, and also try to spend time with my family as well, though my streams normally start around 7 o'clock EST.</li>
            <li><strong>Where am I Located?</strong><br> I am in Kentucky, and plan on staying here.</li>
            <li><strong>Who do I Play With?</strong><br> You will often hear me refer to my friends by their real names. If they have a twitch channel, they will be linked under the friends' channels section down below.</li>
            <li><strong>What are your computer specs?</strong><br> I will also have a list of my specs in a list down below.</li>
